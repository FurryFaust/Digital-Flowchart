# Digital-Waveform
Generate digital flowcharts from binary sequences and can compare them using boolean algebra. This tool is written alongside the Sematics-UI and jQuery library.

Basic Chart Generating Usage
----------------------------
Enter your binary sequence and the name. Here we enter 'A' as the name and '10101001111' as the sequence.

If you want more charts, hit the '+' button and enter the same format and then hit 'update'. This can be done up to
four times.

Later we can compare these two charts using boolean algebra.
